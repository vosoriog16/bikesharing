# Bikesharing

# Overview:

The purpose of this challenge was to create vizualizations in Tableau to determine different data about New York's Citi Bikes usage including checkout times for users, checkout times by gender, which hours and days were most prominent for bike usage by gender, the number of bike trips for all riders, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results:

This shows that most bike rides have 0-59 minute trip duration which is the most popular time for all transactions.

This visualization shows that 5-10 minutes is the most popular duartion and men have the highest number of usage in the 0-60 minute range.

This heatmap shows that 5 and 6 pm are the most popular times for bike trips. The darker colors indicates higher usage. During the week Monday-Friday the usage was highest in the morning around 8am and highest in the evening at 5.

# Summary: 

Based off the analysis, we can see there is a large percentage of male riders and they are are work commuters given the peak times in morning and evening. Also, results show that the most popular times to ride are after work off work, normally around 5 or 6pm. For another visualizatiion I would look into age to investigate the average age of residents taht bike ride and compare which a ge range would have highest subscribers.
